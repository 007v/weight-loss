# Frequently asked Questions, Answers and Comments

------------------

#### I'm not a coder, this is too difficult to use

> I hear you. One reason I put this on github is so others can take it further: write a web or mail service on top, or even a smart-phone app.
>
> Since publishing I've become aware of one site using this work as a back-end. Please note this is very early, experimental, work in progress:
>
>    ***[weightbrains.com](http://weightbrains.com)***
>
> It would be cool to see more people taking this work further.

#### This is an example of how to not do scientific research!

> Indeed, this is not scientific research.   Rather, this is:
>
>   - Software that can help you make sense of your own data
>   - Sharing in hope of further work and improvement
>   - A personal story of discovery
>   - In the end (judging by results) - a success story

#### Isn't factor X missing (e.g. Coffee)?

> Yes, many things are missing.  I encourage you to use your own data, and what you personally feel is most important.


#### Doesn't dehydration and depleting Glycogen in the liver explain most of this weight loss?

> No.  I can't attribute over 20 Lb loss over 1 year to water loss.

#### Doesn't caloric restriction explain all of this weight loss?

> This may be true.  I haven't counted calories and a more thorough experiment should add all the data it can use.
>
> However, I tried multiple times to restrict my diet and was not successful.  What led to success in my case is a combination of physiological and psychological factors. Most importantly, the realization that by trying a LCHF (Low Carb, High Fat) diet, I can sustain a diet regime (possibly calorie restricted, I don't know) that lead to a clear and sustainable weight loss.
>
> The story is about the discovery process of what worked for me in the end.

#### Machine learning: aren't you over-fitting the data?

> Possibly, as the number of days in the data (about 40) is small and may even have some errors in it.
>
> OTOH: I tried many combinations, data-subsets, shufflings, bootstrapping, and while the small details varied, the main conclusions were very consistent: Longer sleep, Low carb, high fat, were leading me to losing weight.
>
> More data, and data from many people is always welcome!
>

#### Can you tell the story of how it went viral, and how does it feel to go Viral?

>
> From my PoV, it was an accidental success.
>
> I was trying to lose weight, and since I'm into ML, I found it natural to us some machine learning to guide me. Indeed it helped.
>
> When I told this to a colleague of mine, she suggested I really have to share this more widely. So I dusted it up a it, cleaned the code to make it a bit more usable by others, wrote a few pages of background and put it on github.
>
> On github it sat for a few months with zero forks, zero stars, zero watchers, totally ignored by the world :-)
>
> Then some guy named Dmitri noticed it, and posted a link to Hacker News (news at Ycombinator.com)...
>
> The reaction was overwhelming.
>
> Some minutes later, I get an email from someone else I don't know, Victor, via github, saying "Congratulations, you've just made it to the top of HN..."
>
> It was a Friday evening. That's weekend I couldn't sleep. My mailbox was exploding too. It went viral over the interwebs. Hundreds of comments, thousands of stars on the github repository, many forks, people offering me jobs, invites to present at conferences, you name it.
>
>  Follow-ups on Reddit, Quora, and it quickly became the top unpaid link on google when searching for a few terms combining weight-loss and machine-learning.
>
> At moment like this, one wishes they had two copies of oneself. I have another life too.
