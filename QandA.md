# Frequently asked questions and Answers

#### I'm not a coder, this is too difficult to use

> I hear you. One reason I put this on github is so others can take it further: write a web or mail service on top, or even a smart-phone app.

> Since publishing I've become aware of one site using this work as a back-end. Please note this is very early, experimental, work in progress:

> It would be cool to see more people taking this work further.

#### This is an example of how to not do scientific research!

> Indeed, this is not scientific research.   Rather, this is:
>
>   - Software that can help you make sense of your own data
>   - Sharing in hope of further work and improvement
>   - A personal story of discovery
>   - In the end (judging by results) - a success story

#### Isn't factor X missing (e.g. Coffee)?

> Yes, many things are missing.  I encourage you to use your own data, and what you personally feel is most important.


#### Doesn't dehydration and depleting Glycogen in the liver explain most of this weight loss?

> No.  I can't attribute over 20 Lb loss over 1 year to water loss.

#### Doesn't caloric restriction explain all of this weight loss?

> This may be true.  I haven't counted calories and a more thorogh experiment should add all the data it can use.
>
> However, I tried multiple times to restrict my diet and was not successful.  What led to success in my case is a combination of physiological and psychological factors. Most importantly, the realization that by trying a LCHF (Low Carb, High Fat) diet, I can sustain a diet regime (possibly calorie restricted, I don't know) that lead to a clear and sustainable weight loss.

> The story is about the discovery process of what worked for me in the end.

#### Machine learning: aren't you overfitting the data?

> Possibly, although I tried many combinations, data-subsets, shufflings, bootstrapping, and while the small details varied, the main conclusions were very consistent: Longer sleep, Low carb, high fat, were leading me to losing weight.
>
> More data, and data from many people is always welcome!
